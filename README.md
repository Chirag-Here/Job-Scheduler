This repository contains a Job Scheduler implementation in C++ that simulates the scheduling of tasks (or jobs) based on various operating system concepts. The project integrates fundamental OS scheduling algorithms, synchronization mechanisms, and resource management techniques to simulate a real-world job scheduler.
Key Features:

    SCF (Shortest Completion Time First): Implements the Shortest Completion Time First (SCTF) scheduling algorithm, which prioritizes jobs with the shortest estimated completion times.
    Scheduling Algorithms: Supports multiple scheduling algorithms including:
        FCFS (First Come, First Serve)
        SJF (Shortest Job First)
        Round Robin
        Priority Scheduling
    Synchronization Mechanisms: Utilizes synchronization methods like mutexes and semaphores to simulate job execution and resource sharing, ensuring thread safety and proper job scheduling.
    Job Queues: Manages job queues for scheduling and prioritizing tasks.
    Time Simulation: Simulates the passing of time during job execution, with dynamic adjustment of job priorities and durations.

Built With:

    C++ Standard Library
    Basic OS Concepts: Process Scheduling, Synchronization, Resource Allocation

Installation:

    Clone the repository:

    bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/job-scheduler.git

Navigate to the project directory:

bash

cd job-scheduler

Compile and run the project using a C++ compiler:

bash

    g++ -o scheduler main.cpp
    ./scheduler

Usage:

The scheduler allows you to define jobs with specific burst times, priorities, and other parameters, and then choose a scheduling algorithm to manage and execute them. You can modify the job parameters and observe the execution sequence for different algorithms.
Future Improvements:

    Integration of more advanced scheduling algorithms like Multilevel Queue Scheduling and Multilevel Feedback Queue.
    Enhanced user interface for easier job configuration and scheduling simulation.
    Handling of I/O-bound and CPU-bound jobs separately.
